# Glowforge External Fan Controller


This program is designed to read the voltage from the fan pin on the Glowforge laser cutter. When the pin is high, a relay is turned on to run an exhaust fan. After the voltage drops back to 0, the fan runs for a little longer to allow for better exhaust of fumes.
